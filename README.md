## User Stories
- As a user, I will be able to sign-up, sign-in, change my password and log off easily.
- I will be able to search for existing beers in the database, read information about them and rate them.
- I will be able to view my ratings from the past and edit or delete them as I see fit.

## Future User Stories
- I will be able to connect with others and see the ratings they have created.
- I will be able to add a beer on my own if it doesn't already exist in the database.

## The Project
This project was a great introduction to using Ruby on Rails and building my own back-end API as well as a great continutation of honing my skills on the front end. As an avid craft beer enthusiast, it seemed like a natural fit for my first big project to be an amalgamation of two of my greatest passions. I felt much more comfortable writing code in JS and jQuery than I did on my last project and am very happy with the way the page is styled.

## Challenges
One of my biggest challenges in this project was connecting the front-end AJAX requests with the back end and subsequently the third party API. With so many requests firing depending on user interaction, it was tough to seperate my concerns so that no request would get in the way of another. Also, I found it difficult at first to use handlebars in order to diaply the results of a beer search or random beer generation in the proper way on the screen. Eventually, I figured it out and found handlebars to be a very powerful tool when developing.

## Future Plans
This project is far from done! I plan on making a way for users to connect with other users and view the beers they have rated. Also, I would like to make it possible to search my brewery and make my search parameters much more broad than they are now. In order to do this, I will be adding a Beer table to my back-end and filling it with existing data from open brewery databases and allowing users to add beers when they are not present.
